            <h2>Glacier National Park</h2>
            <p>Bear! I could bear-ly contain my excitement during my trek when we stumbled across a mama bear and her cub. My dad, immediately concerned, was later proud that my first instinct wasn't to run, but to pull my camera out and shoot. It was overall, a frightening experience. Being pushed back a half mile by a bear, and then disappearing into the woods without a trace is majestic and horrifying. How do those lumbering and large beasts remain so gentle and quiet? </p>

            <h2>Glendalough National Park</h2>
            <p>Smiles are bright and energy levels are high. We have just hiked two miles, mostly uphill. We are feeling very strong and the rolling valleys of Glendalough National Park have us in good spirits. We have yet to discover this hike is 11 miles in total.</p>

            <h2>Connemara National Park</h2>
            <p>The long descent begins. Not only towards the end of the hike, but towards the end of the trip. This last image is the final in my series of photographs taken during Summer 2022. I was fortunate enough to have gone to three national parks. A trip to Glacier National Park and a trip to Ireland which brought me to two national parks there. Having my camera strapped to me constantly, I was able to take these photos and more. </p>
