            <p>Bear! I could bear-ly contain my excitment during my trek when we stumbled acrossed a mama bear and her cub. My dad, immedate with concern, was later proud that my first instinct wasn't too run, but to pull my camera out and shoot. It was overall, a frightening expierence. Being pushed back a half mile by a bear, and then it disappearing into the woods without a trace is majestic and horrifying. How do those lumbering and large beasts remain so gentle and quiet? </p>
